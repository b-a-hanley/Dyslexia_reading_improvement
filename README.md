# Dyslexia_reading_improvement

## Introduction

Dyslexia_reading_improvement is a training environment designed to assist dyslexic readers, like myself, in developing reading comprehension skills and potentially improving reading speed. Inspired by individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who often adopt unique reading strategies, such as focusing on the first and last letters of words, this game aims to leverage those strategies to enhance reading abilities. It is laid out as a Word Guessing Game where the aim is to guess the word hidden in front of you. Each word provided will start and end with capitalized letters, giving you a clue to get started. Use your deduction skills and clues wisely to score points and test your word-guessing abilities.

## Instructions

**Aim of the game:** Your objective is to guess the word hidden in front of you. The word will be provided, with the first and last letters capitalized to give you a clue.

**Requesting clues:** You can request clues to help you guess the word. Type "clue1" for the first clue, "clue2" for the second clue, or "clue3" for the third clue. These clues progressively make it easier to guess the word.

**Scoring system:**
- Guessing the word correctly without any clues earns you 5 points.
- Guessing correctly with clue1 earns 3 points.
- Guessing correctly with clue2 earns 2 points.
- Guessing correctly with clue3 earns 1 point.

**Gameplay:** Be careful! Guessing the word incorrectly will result in losing the game. Take your time and consider your guess carefully before submitting it.

**Earning points:** You can earn points each round based on your correct guesses. Aim to accumulate as many points as possible to improve your score and challenge yourself.

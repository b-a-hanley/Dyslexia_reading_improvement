Introduction

The Unique Reading Strategies Game is a training environment designed to assist dyslexic readers, like myself, in developing reading comprehension skills and potentially improving reading speed. Inspired by individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who often adopt unique reading strategies, such as focusing on the first and last letters of words, this game aims to leverage those strategies to enhance reading abilities.
